# UK-Topojson

Provides browseable TopoJson data for various types of boundaries in UK/GB.

GeoJson files extracted from the Geojson API provided at:
http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/

These were then converted into Topojson using:
http://mapshaper.org/

The URLs of the raw files can be used to add these as layers onto a D3/Leflet map.
